# 2. AI Model Evaluation

Date: 2025-05-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the initial version, we need to select an appropriate AI model to evaluate and analyze code. This decision impacts:

- Code analysis accuracy and reliability
- Response time and performance
- Cost implications
- Integration complexity
- Maintenance overhead

## Decision

For the first iteration of the project we will use Anthropic's Claude. Currently it is one of the best models for code evaluation and committed to ethical guidelines.

In the future we may add different models and make the choice of which to use configurable.

## Consequences

By choosing only one AI model it will make implementation less complicated initially but may make using additional models in the future more complicated to implement.
